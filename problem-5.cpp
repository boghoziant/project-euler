// Problem 5 from Project Euler
// 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

// What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20? 

// This problem seemed easier to solve by only using math instead of a program and math. 
// I just wrote out all numbers from 1 to 20 crossing out those that could be made up of previous ones
// I multiplied the remaining numbers together and got the answer
